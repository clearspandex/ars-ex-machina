# Artificial Intelligence for Art and Design

This repo exists as part curriculum and part textbook for Jonathan's Art and machine learning virtual "course". The course is mainly an indefinite [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thedatawarehaus) series in the form of live lectures/workshops. Recordings of the streams will be edited and augmented (with better graphics) and posted to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi0Hd3U6xb4V0ApUhAIfu9Q) as VODs. Lecture notes and exercises will form an informal interactive textbook and reference if reading is more your speed. 

__Whether you are an artist or designer looking to augment your practice with machine learning or a ML engineer/researcher wanting to make creative applications there should be something for you here!__

<!-- ## Materials

Feel free to engage with as many (or as few) of these resources as you want.

## Prerequisites

- Experience with a scripting language, e.g., Javascript or Python (all code demos will be in Javascript).
- Familiarity with the data science process and machine learning are a plus. -->
